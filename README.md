# DIY-Laser-Tag-With-ESP8266
DIY ESP8266 Laser Tag System is a low-cost, open-source laser tag setup where a single ESP8266 handles both shooting (gun) and hit detection (vest).  The system uses IR communication, runs on AA NiMH batteries, and sends game data over Wi-Fi to a web-based scoreboard. It is designed to be easy to build, easy to modify, and beginner-friendly.
